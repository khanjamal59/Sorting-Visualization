**Sorting Visualization**
This project is a Sorting Visualization Tool created using Java Swing. It visually demonstrates sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Quick Sort, allowing users to understand their behavior through animations.

Feature
Interactive Visualization: Watch how sorting algorithms rearrange elements step by step.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Algorithms Supported:*
Bubble Sort
Quick Sort
**User-Friendly Interface:**
Buttons to trigger specific sorting algorithms.
Automatically shuffles the array for a fresh sorting experience each time.
Dynamic Visualization: Adjustable delay for smooth and clear animations.
**How to Run**
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later).
A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or command-line environment.

**How to Use**
-Launch the Application:
         The visualization window will open with a randomly shuffled array.
-Select a Sorting Algorithm:
         Click on the Bubble Sort or Quick Sort button to see the algorithm in action.
-Observe the Sorting Process:
         The algorithm's name is displayed at the top.
         The white bars represent the array elements being sorted.
-Reset and Shuffle:
         After sorting completes, press another button to reset and shuffle the array.
**Customization**
         Array Size: Change the size variable in the code to adjust the number of elements.
         Visualization Speed: Modify the delay in the swap() method to speed up or slow down the animation.
